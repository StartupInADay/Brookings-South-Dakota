Hooray! You made it.

Welcome to our online community. This online community, or Homestead as we call it, is a perfect place to connect with people and mentors in your community. Browse the members by click on the different categories and reach out directly by clicking on their name. You can get help on how to use the site here: http://yourhomestead.org/community/help/

In addition to connecting to homesteaders in your own community, we invite you to join city builders, creatives and leaders from around the country in our Social Tilt community. This national community allows you to chat and share the best ways to build your homestead. It's free and we'd love to have you. Claim your spot here: http://socialtilt.herokuapp.com/

Welcome aboard. Thank you for making your community great.

Regards,

The Homestead Team
